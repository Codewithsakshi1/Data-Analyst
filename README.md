# 📊 Data Analyst Repository  

This repo is my personal space to keep everything I’m learning and practicing in the field of Data Analytics.  
Instead of keeping notes, codes, and projects scattered, I’m putting them all together here so it’s easier to track progress and revisit later.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Sakshi Sharma**, currently pursuing my **B.Tech from AKTU University**.  
I have a strong interest in the **Data domain** and I really enjoy working with data, exploring it, and finding useful insights from raw information.  

This repository is where I’m collecting my learning material and projects as I build my skills in:  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **SQL** 🗄️  
- **Power BI** 📊  

I created this repo to keep all my work organized in one place and to track my journey of becoming a better Data Analyst.  


I’ll keep adding more material and projects as I continue learning and exploring new tools in analytics.
